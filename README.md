3. Each image appears in the main list with a status indicator

### 2. **Configure Actions**
1. Select an image and click **"‚úèÔ∏è Edit Selected"**
2. In the **Image Settings** tab:
   - Adjust confidence threshold (0.8 is usually perfect)
   - Set individual ROI if you want to limit search area
3. In the **Actions** tab:
   - Add multiple actions (clicks, key presses)
   - Set timing delays before and after each action
   - Reorder actions with up/down buttons

### 3. **Fine-tune Detection**

- Test individual images with **"üß™ Test Selected"** before running

### 4. **Run Automation**
- Click **"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start (F9)"** or press **F9** to begin
- The app scans your screen and executes actions when images are found
- Press **F9** again to stop at any time

### 5. **Save Your Setup**
- Use **File ‚Üí Save Configuration** to store your complete setup
- Load saved configurations with **File ‚Üí Load Configuration**

## How It Works

AutoClicker uses advanced computer vision to find and interact with specific images on your screen, making it perfect for automating repetitive tasks in games, applications, or workflows.

### üîç **Detection Engine**
The application continuously scans your screen using OpenCV's template matching technology:

1. **Screenshot Capture**: Takes periodic screenshots of your screen
2. **Multi-Scale Matching**: Searches for your target images at different scales (80% to 120%)
3. **Confidence Analysis**: Only triggers actions when matches exceed your confidence threshold
4. **ROI Processing**: Limits searches to specific screen regions for speed and accuracy

### ‚ö° **Action Execution**
When a target image is found, the system executes your configured actions:

1. **Pre-Action Delay**: Waits for UI to stabilize (if configured)
2. **Action Sequence**: Performs clicks, key presses, or combinations in order
3. **Smart Mouse Movement**: Moves cursor away from detection areas to avoid interference
4. **Post-Action Delay**: Prevents immediate re-detection of the same element
5. **Scan Pause**: Uses intelligent timing to prevent system overload

### üß† **Intelligence Features**
- **Duplication Prevention**: Smart timing prevents accidental double-actions
- **ROI Awareness**: Mouse movement avoids all active search regions
- **Adaptive Timing**: Uses your delay settings to optimize scan frequency
- **Multi-threading**: Keeps the interface responsive during operation
- **Memory Optimization**: Caches screenshots efficiently to reduce CPU usage

## Advanced Configuration Tips

### üéØ **Optimizing Detection Accuracy**
- **High Confidence (0.9-1.0)**: Use for unique, detailed images with consistent appearance
- **Medium Confidence (0.7-0.8)**: Best for most UI elements and buttons
- **Low Confidence (0.5-0.6)**: Use for images that might change slightly (colors, text)

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Timing Best Practices**
- **Pre-Delay**: Allow time for UI animations or loading (0.1-0.5s typical)
- **Post-Delay**: Prevent re-detection of same element (0.2-1.0s typical)
- **Action Sequences**: Use shorter delays between related actions (0.1-0.2s)

### üìç **ROI Strategy**
- **Individual ROI**: Use for elements that appear in specific screen areas
- **Global ROI**: Set to exclude taskbars, sidebars, or other static UI elements
- **Multiple ROIs**: Combine global and individual ROIs for maximum precision

## System Requirements & Installation

### üíª **System Requirements**
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or Windows 11
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 50MB free disk space
- **Display**: Any resolution supported

### üì• **Installation**
1. Download `AutoClicker.exe` 
2. Run the executable - no installation required!
3. The application is portable and can be run from any folder
4. Windows may show a security warning for unsigned executables - click "Run anyway"

### üîí **Security Note**
This application requires screen capture and input simulation permissions to function. Some antivirus software may flag automation tools as potentially unwanted programs (PUP). The application is safe to use and does not collect or transmit any data.

## Pro Tips for Best Results

### üì∏ **Creating Target Images**
1. **Use Screenshots**: Capture images directly from your target application using Print Screen
2. **Crop to Essential Elements**: Include only the button/element you want to click, not surrounding areas
3. **Avoid Text-Heavy Images**: UI buttons with icons work better than pure text
4. **Consistent Conditions**: Capture images under the same lighting/theme settings you'll use

### üéØ **Optimizing Performance**
1. **Start with Default Settings**: Use 0.8 confidence and test before adjusting
2. **Use ROI Regions**: Limit search areas to dramatically improve speed and reduce false positives
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Always use "Test Selected" to verify detection before running automation
4. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Close unnecessary applications to ensure smooth operation

### üîß **Troubleshooting Detection Issues**
1. **Lower Confidence**: Try 0.6-0.7 if images aren't being detected
2. **Check Image Quality**: Ensure target images are clear and not blurry
3. **Verify Visibility**: Make sure target elements are not covered by other windows
4. **Update Screenshots**: Re-capture images if the application UI has changed

### ‚ö° **Advanced Automation Techniques**
1. **Action Chains**: Use multiple actions per image for complex interactions
2. **Strategic Delays**: Set pre-delays for loading screens, post-delays to prevent spam
3. **Selective Enabling**: Enable only the images you need for specific tasks
4. **Configuration Profiles**: Save different setups for different applications or scenarios

## Troubleshooting Guide

### ‚ùå **Images Not Being Detected**
**Problem**: The app doesn't find your target images on screen
**Solutions**:
- Lower the confidence threshold (try 0.6-0.7) in the image edit dialog
- Ensure target images are visible and not covered by other windows
- Re-capture images if the application UI has changed since original screenshot
- Check that image files aren't corrupted or too small
- Use "Test Selected" to verify detection before running

### ‚ö° **Actions Not Executing Properly**
**Problem**: Images are detected but actions don't work as expected
**Solutions**:
- Increase pre-delay if UI elements need time to appear or load
- Adjust post-delay to prevent rapid re-detection of the same image
- Verify the correct action order in the Actions tab of the edit dialog
- Check that key press syntax is correct for keyboard actions
- Ensure the target application window is active and focused

### üêå **Poor Performance or High CPU Usage**
**Problem**: The application runs slowly or uses too much system resources
**Solutions**:
- Set ROI regions to limit search areas and improve detection speed
- Remove unused or disabled images from your list
- Increase post-delays to reduce scanning frequency
- Close unnecessary applications that may interfere with screen capture
- Lower the confidence threshold slightly to reduce processing overhead

### üñ±Ô∏è **Mouse Movement Issues**
**Problem**: Random mouse movement not working as expected
**Solutions**:
- Ensure ROI regions are properly configured and don't conflict
- Check that random mouse movement is enabled in settings
- Verify that ROI regions don't accidentally cover the entire screen
- Make sure there are accessible areas for mouse movement outside ROIs

### üíæ **Configuration Problems**
**Problem**: Settings don't save or load properly
**Solutions**:
- Check that you have write permissions in the application folder
- Use "Save Configuration" and "Load Configuration" to preserve working setups
- Restart the application if settings changes don't apply correctly
- Ensure configuration files aren't being blocked by antivirus software

### üîí **Security Software Interference**
**Problem**: Antivirus blocks the application or it stops working unexpectedly
**Solutions**:
- Add `AutoClicker.exe` to your antivirus whitelist/exceptions
- Temporarily disable real-time protection during setup and testing
- Run the application as administrator if permission issues occur
- Check Windows Defender exclusions if using Windows built-in security
