# Image-Based AutoClicker

A sophisticated image-based autoclicker application that can detect multiple images on your screen and automatically click on them with advanced features.

## Features

- **Multi-Image Detection**: Add and manage multiple target images simultaneously
- **Advanced Image Matching**: Uses OpenCV template matching with multi-scale detection
- **Modern GUI Interface**: Clean, color-coded tkinter interface with intuitive controls
- **ROI (Region of Interest)**: Limit search area for faster detection and better accuracy
- **Smart Mouse Movement**: Moves mouse to different screen quadrants after clicking to avoid detection
- **Configurable Settings**: 
  - Adjustable confidence threshold for image matching
  - Customizable click delay between detections
  - Maximum click limit option
  - Mouse movement distance control
- **Hotkey Support**: F9 hotkey to start/stop clicking
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows detection status, click count, and confidence scores
- **Performance Optimized**: Screenshot caching and early exit for faster detection

## How to Use

1. **Add Target Images**: 
   - Click "‚ûï Add Images" to select one or multiple image files
   - Hold Ctrl/Cmd to select multiple images at once
   - Manage your images with Remove and Clear All options

2. **Configure Settings**:
   - **Confidence Threshold**: Higher values (0.8-1.0) = more precise matching, lower values (0.3-0.7) = more flexible matching
   - **Click Delay**: Time in seconds between each detection attempt
   - **Max Clicks**: Maximum number of clicks (0 = unlimited)
   - **Mouse Movement**: Enable/disable random mouse movement after clicking
   - **ROI Coordinates**: Set specific screen area to search (format: x1,y1,x2,y2)

3. **Set ROI (Optional)**: 
   - Use "üìç Set ROI" button to interactively select a screen region
   - Or manually enter coordinates in x1,y1,x2,y2 format
   - Leave empty to search entire screen

4. **Test Detection**: Use the "üîç Test Detection" button to verify images can be found on screen

5. **Start Clicking**: 
   - Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Clicking" or press F9 to begin
   - Press F9 again or click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Clicking" to stop

## How It Works

1. **Multi-Scale Template Matching**: Uses OpenCV's advanced template matching with multiple scale factors (0.8x to 1.2x) for robust detection
2. **Screenshot Caching**: Implements intelligent screenshot caching to reduce CPU usage and improve performance
3. **ROI Processing**: When ROI is set, only processes the specified screen region for faster detection
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Only clicks when the match confidence exceeds your threshold
5. **Precise Clicking**: Clicks at the center of the detected image with pixel-perfect accuracy
6. **Smart Mouse Movement**: After clicking, moves mouse to opposite screen quadrant to avoid pattern detection

## Safety Features

- **Thread Safety**: GUI remains responsive during operation with multi-threaded architecture
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of image loading, detection errors, and system exceptions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time feedback on detection confidence and system status

## Supported Image Formats

- PNG
- JPG/JPEG
- BMP
- TIFF
- GIF

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use High-Quality Images**: Screenshots work best as target images
2. **Avoid Generic Images**: Choose unique, distinctive images for better detection accuracy
3. **Optimize Confidence**: Start with 0.8 and adjust based on detection results
4. **Test Before Running**: Always use "Test Detection" to verify image recognition
5. **Set ROI for Speed**: Define specific screen regions to dramatically improve detection speed
6. **Multiple Scales**: The app automatically handles different image sizes, but original scale works best
7. **Stable Lighting**: Consistent screen brightness and color settings improve detection reliability
8. **Unique Targets**: Use images with distinctive colors, shapes, or text for better recognition

## System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (Primary support)
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages:
  - OpenCV (cv2)
  - PyAutoGUI
  - NumPy
  - Pillow (PIL)
  - pynput
  - tkinter (included with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install opencv-python pyautogui numpy pillow pynput`
3. Run: `python main.py`

## Troubleshooting

**Images not detected**:
- Lower the confidence threshold (try 0.6-0.7)
- Ensure target images are visible and not obscured
- Check if images have changed size or appearance
- Try setting a smaller ROI around the target area

**Poor performance**:
- Set ROI to limit search area
- Remove unused images from the list
- Increase click delay to reduce CPU usage
- Close unnecessary applications

**Clicking in wrong location**:
- Increase confidence threshold for better accuracy
- Use more distinctive/unique target images
- Verify image quality and clarity
- Test detection before running
